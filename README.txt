Hi! My name is Josu√© Araya and I am very happy to be applying for this job and to show you the assigned task.

Considerations for running the task:
1. Python 3.8
2. Django

How to run the task?
Open the cmd or Command Prompt, enter the compressed file folder and run the command:
python manage.py runserver

Running the command will enable an address, copy it into any browser.

Website considerations:
1. A main screen will open showing a type of login, however, due to the requirements of the task, 
just click the Login button to enter.
2. When entering the main page, the idea is that the courses that a person is taking are shown and 
can enter each of them, in this case all courses lead to the same base template.
3. In addition, all available courses are shown, a mission and vision of the company, contacts and 
in the "More" button you can see the about of the page and the Log Out that returns to the Login screen.
